# OpenARAS - Open Autonomous Rider Assistance System - Data Recorder
[WIP]

Packages Camera and Radar are from the following repositories:
    - TI mmWave Ros Package [Link](https://github.com/radar-lab/ti_mmwave_rospkg)
    - USB Camera Ros Package [Link](https://github.com/ros-drivers/usb_cam)

NOTE: Since these packages are not maintained and have multiple issues, we have forked them and made necessary changes to make them work with our system. However, initially due to developments we are not usin the fork, but we intend to do the clanup once we get this project to a stable state.

## Sensor Packages for OpenARAS includes   
- Vehicle Dynamics Module 
    - GPS Module
    - IMU Module
    - Speedometer Module
- Camera Module
- Radar Module
